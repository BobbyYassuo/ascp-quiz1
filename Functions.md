# Functions

## Need to Know


A `fuction` is created/called by doing 
```javascript

function doSomething(){ var action= x+1};

```
When you call a function, use camelCase, parentheses and a semicolon: doSomething();

```javascript

var x = function(){}

````



A function can accept things called parameters which are passed in

```javascript

function doSomething(x,y){
}

```

Returning a parameter within a function is done by

```javascript

function doSomething(x){
return x*5;
}

```
